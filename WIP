	* big transmissions in put/get are now split up, so that there is no
	 timeout anymore
	* Better remote.rb::checkIt, which also looks for different accounts

	* Fixed the counter, check is OK

	Problem with checking-in remote accounts, because the order is not kept,
	and then the children come before the parents.
	remote.rb::remote_check::put_entry puts in a counter, which should be used
	in remote.rb::doCheckFix to sort the accounts.
	
	TODO:
	* the counter is not at the start, but in the middle
	* the movements also have the counter, which should be taken out
