	+ Archive accounts and movements and hide them
	+ Put money from multiple into multiple accounts, but only once into any

	+ Speed up merge
		- Accounts and Movements get a changed "revision":
		 it is a global (one for Accounts and one for Movements)
		 counter that increases steadily. If something is changed,
		 the counter gets increased by one.
		  Remote.account_index and Remote.movement_index point to the
		 last Account and Movement transferred, while
		  User.account_index and User.movement_index do the same on
		 the server side
		  User('local').account_index and User('local').movement_index
		 point to the actual index used in the local database
